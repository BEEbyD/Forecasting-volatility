# Forecasting-volatility-by-using-wavelet-transform-ARIMA-and-GARCH-
Forecasting stock volatility is crucial for investors to assess trading risks and make informed decisions. This work investigates time series forecasting methods, particularly ARIMA and GARCH models, commonly used in finance due to their low computational demands. To enhance ARIMA predictions, the discrete Fourier transform is applied as pre-processing, leading to a wavelet ARIMA approach. However, ARIMA’s linear nature limits its ability to capture non-linear volatility patterns. To address this, two hybrid models are proposed, combining wavelet ARIMA and GARCH to capture both linear and non-linear patterns. The study evaluates these hybrid methods on Tesla’s highly volatile stock, aiming to identify the most effective prediction model.
